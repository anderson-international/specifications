# Hello AI - A New Chat Conversation Initialization

## Purpose
This workflow establishes conversation goals, sets approval gates, and selects appropriate context loaders for efficient AI-assisted development.

## **CRITICAL AI INSTRUCTION**
Perform the steps below sequentially. Do not skip any steps. Do not rely on memories of previous runs of this workflow. Ensure you run the each workflow marked with the /run command.

## Step 1

### Step 1.1 - Initialise Command Syntax
/run code-critical

### Step 1.2: Set Approval Gates
**AI INSTRUCTION**: You must operate under these mandatory constraints:

#### Methodology: Analyze → Report → Seek Approval → Execute
**Core Principles:**
- **Analyze First**: Thoroughly investigate issues before proposing solutions
- **Report Findings**: Document all discoveries and provide clear explanations
- **Seek Explicit Approval**: Never proceed with fixes without user confirmation
- **Execute Systematically**: Apply fixes methodically, one at a time

### Step 1.3: Establish Goal(s)
**AI ACTION REQUIRED**: 
 - Establish the goal of this conversation.
 - Ask follow on questions until satisfied you have understood the goal.
 - **Important**: Questions should be asked one at a time. 


## Step 2 Load Vital Context

### Step 2.1: Load task specific context
/run auto-context

### Step 2.2: Load code quality validation guidance and tool usage
/run code-validation
